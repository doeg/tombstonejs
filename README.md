# tombstonejs
ascii tombstones

(this code is gross and I don't want to hear about it!) 

#### developing
```bash
# Install the dependencies
npm install

# Start the watch server
npm run watch

# Serve the static files (this is just one example)
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
open http://localhost:8000
```
